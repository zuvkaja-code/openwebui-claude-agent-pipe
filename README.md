# Open WebUI Claude Agent Pipe

An [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) pipe function that runs each chat turn as a headless [Claude Agent SDK](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) session: Claude Code's full agent loop, with a real working directory and tools, behind a normal chat UI, billed to your Claude subscription. It is for one person (or one trusted admin) who already runs Open WebUI and wants Claude Code in it, on the web and on mobile clients, rather than only in a terminal.

The agent can stop mid-turn and ask through Open WebUI's own form:

Every reply ends with what the turn cost:

## Credit

This is a fork of Thomas Friedel's [openwebui-claude-code](https://github.com/tfriedel/openwebui-claude-code) (MIT), taken at commit `5bbc1fc`. He built the bridge: the pipe, the valves, the knowledge-base tools, inline tool details, image attachments, and the artifact scanner are his work and still form the backbone of this file. This repo adds durable sessions, output redaction, the status stream, `ask_user`, chat search, and the rest of the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) on top, and maintains it now that upstream has gone quiet. If you find it useful, his repo is where the idea came from.

## Features

- **Real agent loop** — Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Glob/Grep/WebSearch/WebFetch and subagents, in a per-chat working directory, streamed token by token.
- **Durable sessions** — each chat maps to one Claude Code session that survives Open WebUI restarts and function redeploys (in a container, set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to a persistent path too); a cold start replays the chat history once and resumes warm from then on.
- **Keyless clients** — OpenAI-API callers that send no chat id (mobile apps, voice) get a session too, fingerprinted from the conversation prefix.
- **Live status** — tool activity, a heartbeat while a tool runs, subagents grouped under their parent, and a `Done · 1m42s · 74k/200k (37%) · 12 tools` line at the end; the message's ⓘ usage popover also gets the turn's duration and the subscription's usage windows (session, weekly, per-model, extra usage) with the time left until each resets.
- **`ask_user`** — the agent can pause and ask up to four multiple-choice questions through Open WebUI's own form, and get the answers in the same turn.
- **Earlier chats** — `search_chats` / `read_chat` let the agent look up the calling user's past conversations (sqlite deployments; read-only; scoped to that user).
- **Knowledge bases** — a Workspace Model's attached knowledge becomes `search_knowledge` / `list` / `read` / `grep` tools the agent calls itself.
- **Images and artifacts** — attached images are written to the workdir for the agent to read; files the agent creates in the workdir (and in `/tmp`, if `SCAN_TMP_ARTIFACTS` is on) come back inline or as links.
- **Repo-rooted chats** — `#repo:<name>` on a first message runs the chat inside an allowlisted repository (and loads its `CLAUDE.md` when `SETTING_SOURCES` includes `project`).
- **Output redaction** — API keys, tokens and private keys are scrubbed from the reply stream and status events before they reach the chat database.
- **Effort, budget, fallback** — per-turn `/effort <level>`, a task token budget the model paces itself against, and a fallback model.

## Requirements

- Open WebUI with the Functions framework; tested on 0.11.3.
- The Python Open WebUI runs on (3.11 or newer). `claude-agent-sdk` 0.2.152 or newer is installed by Open WebUI from the file's `requirements:` line and bundles the Claude Code CLI, so no Node.js and no separate `claude` install on the host.
- A Claude Pro/Max/Team subscription (one-time `claude setup-token` on any machine with a browser) or an Anthropic API key.
- A directory the Open WebUI process can write, for `WORKDIR_ROOT`.

Tested on macOS 15 (native install) and on Linux as root in the official `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main` image, with Open WebUI 0.11.3, `claude-agent-sdk` 0.2.152, Claude Code CLI 2.1.259.

## Install

Five steps: a token, the function, its valves, the toggle, a first message.

### 1. Get a token

On any machine with a browser and Claude Code installed:

```sh
claude setup-token
```

Copy the long-lived OAuth token it prints. This is the sanctioned way to run the Agent SDK on a Pro/Max/Team subscription. An `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` works too, billed per token.

### 2. Add the function

In the UI: Admin Panel → Functions → **+**, paste the contents of `claude_agent_pipe.py` from the [latest release](https://github.com/dancormier/openwebui-claude-agent-pipe/releases/latest) (the file on `main` may be ahead of the changelog), set the id to `claude_code` and any name, Save.

Or over the admin API (bash, from the repository root):

```sh
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/functions/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWUI_ADMIN_KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @<(python3 -c 'import json;print(json.dumps({"id":"claude_code","name":"Claude Code","meta":{"description":"Claude Code agent loop"},"content":open("claude_agent_pipe.py").read()}))')
```

Either way, Open WebUI installs `claude-agent-sdk` from the file's `requirements:` line on save. Allow a minute. Two things can go wrong:

- The save fails with "Error creating function": the install did not succeed. Check the Open WebUI log for the pip error.
- The host runs with `OFFLINE_MODE=true`: Open WebUI skips the install entirely. Install the SDK into Open WebUI's Python environment yourself (`pip install 'claude-agent-sdk>=0.2.152'`) and save again.

### 3. Set the valves

Functions → Claude Code → ⚙ Valves. Two matter on first install:

- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`: the token from step 1.
- `WORKDIR_ROOT`: a directory the Open WebUI process can write. The default is `/tmp/claude-agent-pipe`; use a persistent path so sessions survive reboots.

In a container, also set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to a persistent path (for example a subdirectory of a bind-mounted `WORKDIR_ROOT`). The Claude Code CLI keeps its session transcripts there; left at the default they live in the container's `$HOME/.claude` and vanish when the image is recreated.

Read the [Security](#security) section before leaving `PERMISSION_MODE` at its default. Every other valve is described in [docs/valves.md](docs/valves.md), generated from the code so it is always current.

Over the API, valves are a JSON object posted to `POST /api/v1/functions/id/claude_code/valves/update`.

### 4. Enable it

Flip the toggle on the Functions page (or `POST /api/v1/functions/id/claude_code/toggle`), then pick **Claude Code** in the model picker. `MODELS` adds one picker entry per extra model id; the API model id is `claude_code.claude-code`.

### 5. Send a message

The status line shows `Session: new chat`, then tool activity, then the Done line. A second message shows `Session: resumed`.

### Uninstall

Disable and delete the function in Admin Panel → Functions, then remove `WORKDIR_ROOT` (and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if you set one). Nothing else is written outside those two directories and Open WebUI's own database.

## How it works

`pipe()` is called once per turn. It resolves the working directory (`WORKDIR_ROOT/<chat_id>`, or `anon-<uuid>` for keyless callers, or the `#repo:` target), decides whether a Claude Code session can be resumed, and runs the turn through `ClaudeSDKClient`, translating the SDK's message stream into text chunks and Open WebUI status events.

- **Sessions.** The chat id → session id map is persisted to `WORKDIR_ROOT/.sessions/<chat_id>.json`; the in-process dict is only a cache. Keyless callers are fingerprinted from their conversation prefix into `WORKDIR_ROOT/_sessions.json` (entries expire after 30 days). A dead resume id is dropped and the turn is retried cold.
- **Cold starts.** When no session can be resumed, the prior turns are packed into a `<conversation_history>` block ahead of the prompt (last 30 messages, 24k chars), so nothing is lost; the next turn resumes warm.
- **Tools.** Everything Claude Code has, gated by `ALLOWED_TOOLS` and `PERMISSION_MODE`, plus in-process MCP servers for `ask_user`, chat search, and knowledge. Those are registered with `alwaysLoad` because Claude Code 2.1 otherwise hides MCP tools behind `ToolSearch` and the model never finds them.
- **The agent's environment.** The chat id is exported to the agent's subprocess as `HUB_CHAT_ID` (only when one exists), so tooling the agent runs can find out which chat it is serving. Nothing in this repo reads it.
- **Redaction.** Every chunk and event passes through `_redact_secrets` before leaving `pipe()`. A hit is logged by kind, never by value.

## Security

Read this before exposing the function to anyone but yourself.

- **`bypassPermissions` is the default.** Every user who can pick the model runs arbitrary code as the Open WebUI process user, on the Open WebUI host, with no prompts, using your OAuth token. Treat the function as a shell for everyone it is enabled for. Restrict it to admins in Open WebUI's model access controls, or tighten `PERMISSION_MODE` and `ALLOWED_TOOLS`.
- **Valves are global.** One token, one `WORKDIR_ROOT`, one `REPO_MAP` for every user of the function. Two users cannot read each other's chats (chat search is scoped by user id) but they share the filesystem and the subscription. This is a single-user or single-admin design.
- **`REPO_MAP` hands out paths.** Anyone who can start a `#repo:` chat runs the agent inside that repository. It grants nothing `bypassPermissions` did not already reach; it only sets the working directory.
- **`SETTING_SOURCES`** loads the host user's `~/.claude` (with `user`), which can define hooks that execute code. Leave it empty unless you control the host account; see [Persistent context](#persistent-context).
- **What the redactor catches:** prefix-shaped credentials (Anthropic, OpenAI, Slack, GitHub, Google, AWS, 1Password, JWTs) and PEM private keys, in the reply and in status events. **What it cannot catch:** bare UUID tokens, passwords, hostnames, or anything that looks like prose. The agent can still `cat` a secret into a file the chat never sees. Keep credentials out of `WORKDIR_ROOT` and the mapped repos, or give the agent a hook (Claude Code's `PreToolUse`) that refuses to publish them.
- **Running as root** (the official Docker image does) makes the CLI refuse `bypassPermissions` unless `IS_SANDBOX=1`; the pipe sets it. That is the CLI's own sandbox flag, not an actual sandbox.

Report a vulnerability as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Persistent context

By default the pipe passes `setting_sources=[]` to the SDK: each chat starts from a clean baseline and inherits nothing from the host user's `~/.claude/` or the workdir's `.claude/`. That is the safe default for anything shared.

On a single-user instance, standing instructions in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (a host inventory, house rules) can be loaded into every chat with the `SETTING_SOURCES` valve:

| Value | Loads |
|---|---|
| *(empty)* | Nothing; isolated baseline (default). |
| `user` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` **and** `~/.claude/settings.json`. |
| `project` | The working directory's `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/settings.json`; what makes `#repo:` chats pick up a repository's own instructions. |
| `user,project,local` | Both of the above plus `.claude/settings.local.json`. |

Unknown tokens are dropped. There is no way to load a `CLAUDE.md` without also loading the `settings.json` next to it: that coupling is Claude Code's, not the pipe's, and `settings.json` can define hooks that run shell commands, permission grants, environment variables and ...
